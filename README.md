This package includes the following files:

(1) 'DataGeneration.R' includes functions for generating data under each scenario given in the article.

Note: CreateData.R and TestFuns.R files are called in the McLean's data generation R code.

(2) 'Testing_for_Linearity.R' includes R codes for GarciaEtal, McLeanEtal, and HorvathEtal methods to 
test for the linearity of the effect of functional covariate.

(2) 'Testing_for_Nullity.R' includes R codes for GarciaEtal, McLeanEtal, and KongEtal methods to test 
for the nullity of the effect of functional covariate.
